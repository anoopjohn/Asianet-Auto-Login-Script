Copyright (c) 2009 Anoop John, Prasad S. R. (www.zyxware.com)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: auto-login.sh [auto|startup|free|logout|*]
  auto    - Logs in if not logged in, else logs out. 
  startup - Startup mode, keeps a connection always on.
  free    - Keeps connection alive only during free download hours.
  logout  - Disconnect.
  *       - Connect.

Features
--------
- Automatically connect to Asianet Dataline without having to sign in via the
  browser.
- In startup and free mode the script will keep the connection alive.
- The script will automatically reconnect if connection breaks because of a 
  power failure or a line problem.
- In free mode the script will call any related startup and shutdown scripts 
  placed inside the ~/.auto-login/startup and ~/.auto-login/shutdown folders.

Setup Instructions
------------------
a) Copy script to your favorite scripts folder.
b) Edit script to update username and password with your Asianet login
   information.
c) Add script to your startup process. See different ways of using the script
   below to know more.
d) If you want to start and stop other applications at the time of starting the 
   script then create a folder ~/.auto-login and inside that create sub-folders 
   startup and shutdown. Place other scripts that have to be called during 
   startup and shutdown of this script into the respective folders. Make sure 
   that these scripts have their executable bit set.
e) To ensure that your computer clock is running correctly you might want to 
   run a cron job as root user to run ntpdate twice a day perhaps before the 
   free time starts and before the free time ends

Different ways of using the script
----------------------------------
1) Add a shortcut to your task bar to launch the script with the parameter 
   "auto". Use this shortcut to start the connection with one click and stop the 
   connection with one click. Remember that the connection will time out if 
   there is no activity. But that should not be a problem because you can 
   connect again with a single click.
2) Add the script to your startup process with parameter "startup". This will 
   keep the script running in the background and the script will keep the 
   connection alive with keep-alive requests.
3) Add the script to your startup process with parameter "free". This will keep 
   the script running in the background and the script will connect only during
   the free download hours and then it will keep the connection alive with 
   keep-alive requests until the free time ends. When free time ends it will 
   disconnect the connection. In this mode the script will also run any related 
   startup and shutdown scripts placed inside the ~/.auto-login/startup and 
   ~/.auto-login/shutdown folders.
